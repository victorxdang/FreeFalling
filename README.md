# Breaking Walls
 

A casual "endless runner" game that takes a different twist. Instead of going forward, the player will fall downwards into an endless void. Fall through the rings to get points, and remember, different color gives different amount of points.

<br>

## Gameplay
* Move the ball around by tilting your phone or by using the D-Pad on the UI.
* Fall through the middle of the rings to gain points!
* Avoid the obstacles and the sides of the rings, else back things will happen...
* Relaxing background music to listen to.

## Features
* Google Ad-Mob integration (no other ad networks implemented). Banner, interstitial and rewarded video ads are implemented throughout the game.

## Technical Features
* Ball shatters using basic physics.
* The ball itself will be static while all other objects will be moving upwards towards the player.
* All of the obstacles and rings that spawn are pooled, so all objects seen in game are reused to ensure that ystem resources are preserved and performance is maintained.
* Calibration will be performed before every game automatically so that the user can maintain their current position when holding the phone. No need to manually calibrate unless switching from the D-Pad to tilt.
* Calibration is required since the phone can be tilted on two axes.
